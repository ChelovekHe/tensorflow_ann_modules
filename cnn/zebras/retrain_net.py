"""Simple transfer learning with an Inception v3 architecture model.

This example shows how to take a Inception v3 architecture model trained on
ImageNet images, and train a new top layer that can recognize other classes of
images.

The top layer receives as input a 2048-dimensional vector for each image. We
train a softmax layer on top of this representation. Assuming the softmax layer
contains N labels, this corresponds to learning N + 2048*N model parameters
corresponding to the learned biases and weights.

Here's an example, which assumes you have a folder containing class-named
subfolders, each full of images for each label. The example folder flower_photos
should have a structure like this:

~/flower_photos/daisy/photo1.jpg
~/flower_photos/daisy/photo2.jpg
...
~/flower_photos/rose/anotherphoto77.jpg
...
~/flower_photos/sunflower/somepicture.jpg

The subfolder names are important, since they define what label is applied to
each image, but the filenames themselves don't matter. Once your images are
prepared, you can run the training with a command like this:

bazel build third_party/tensorflow/examples/image_retraining:retrain && \
bazel-bin/third_party/tensorflow/examples/image_retraining/retrain \
--image_dir ~/flower_photos

You can replace the image_dir argument with any folder containing subfolders of
images. The label for each image is taken from the name of the subfolder it's
in.

This produces a new model file that can be loaded and run by any TensorFlow
program, for example the label_image sample code.
